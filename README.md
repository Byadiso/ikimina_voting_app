# Ikimina Voting App

Welcome to the **Ikimina Voting App**, a simple, user-friendly React-based web application where users can log in, perform tests, generate random numbers, and vote. It includes a modern UI and supports features like login persistence, logout functionality, and a voting process.

## Features

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: For building the user interface (UI).
